# `pytidyverse` - A simple python wrapper to easily import packages that were designed to syntactically mimic the `R tidyverse` 

Install the package with pip:

    pip install pytidyverse
    
Load the functions into your script with:

    from pytidyverse import *
    
You now have access to all of the main functions provided by the packages:

1) [`dplython`](https://pythonhosted.org/dplython/)
2) [`ggplot`](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/)
3) [`tidypython`](https://github.com/durrantmm/tidypython)
4) [`readpy`](https://github.com/durrantmm/readpy)
